# RCVV-App
iOS counterpart of the Rose Cottage Visiting Volunteers application and the front end of the system. The MERN Stack exists at a backend at https://github.com/Delta183/RCVV_Backend_Site

## Background

This is an app created by myself and Sawyer Fenwick on behalf of the organization Rose Cottage Visiting Volunteers that will make their services have increased accessibility and improved performance and convenience for users. 
It is a project that we are very interested in completing for the sake of acquiring industry experience. It also serves as a pratice grounds for Kotlin and SwiftUI, both languages that will facilitate an easier development with mobile apps.

## Prerequisites

No special prerequisites are needed beyond Xcode in order to run a simulator such that it can be executed. Note that this was initially designed for iPhone 14 devices.

## Setup

Once the IDE (Xcode) is set up with the project, it can be run on the simulated device shortly after a build. However, for testing on a phone, additional steps will have to be taken involving setting the phone into developer mode and subsequently 'trusting' the developer. Afterwards, you can execute it on the phone for testing purposes.

## How to Use

Currently, the build isn't final so there are placeholder elements but you will be greeted with a screen holding articles in bubbles that can be clicked for further information.
Additionally, there is a sidebar to navigate to other parts of the app that will link to other services of RCVV.
